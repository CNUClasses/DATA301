                Jupyter notebooks are a great way to prototype; you can write a bit of code, test it and change it without having to restart a python kernel.  
                This is a huge debugging speedup since you only load data once, you do not have to reload it every time you change your code.<br>
                On the other hand, the debugger is primitive when compared to a full fledged IDE like PyCharm.<br>
                Also jupyter notebooks are used to prototype your solution.  Once everything works, you'll probably export the salient bits to packages and scripts to be used by other components, like a webservice or dashboard.<br>
                <!-- STOPPED WORKING 1/8/23-What's a dashboard? Its a way to aggregate and interactively display data in a user friendly way.

Then you can choose a smaller set of the most useful features to develop initially and have more confidence that your time will be well spent. -->

            <!-- The metric we'll use is called "mutual information". Mutual information is a lot like correlation in that it measures a relationship between two quantities. The advantage of mutual information is that it can detect any kind of relationship, while correlation only detects linear relationships. -->

                Drugs- clinical trials are expensive and there are a lot of drugs-  How do you select candidates for trial?   List of components, list of uses, effectiveness
                what you can see in data without predictions (melborne housing dataset, use to see where growth is happenning).  What else do you need?  Maybe prevaling interest rate feature.

                    But first and foremost you want the correct answer, PCA will get the same answer every time, while t-SNE will not given it's probablistic nature and potential to get stuck in local minima.  In other words, you likely get different answers on different runs for t-SNE (it may also find structure where none exists). OTOH, it generates pretty clusters.<br>

                <!-- a script which does all the data preprocessing steps shown in the jupyter notebook -->
                <br><br>Jupyter notebooks are for rapid prototyping. They make it easy to load data once, and then iteratively and quickly run and document experiments. 
                They are not meant for production environments since they tend to display lots of UI and require intervention to run each cell.  
                If your notebook is purely exploratory, that is it only plots various aspects of data, then you need do nothing else. 
                If however, your notebook produces something (like a processed dataset), then it's a good idea to port it's relevant content to a script that requires no user interaction, and displays no UI. This approach has the following advantages:<br>
                1. It ensures repeatable results since the script always executes the same way.<br>
                2. The script can be executed by another script, which means it can be a building block used in other processes.<br><br>

                <!--discussed nbconvert and its drawbacks (exports all code when you only want non-ui code).  Before doing any of this write on the board-->
                <ol>
                <li>Ignore all notebook code that explores the data (plotting with matplotlib, seaborn, various DataFrame statistics like unique and value_counts)</li>
                <li>Export relevant functions to a python file (idealy in a seperate package for maximum flexibility).</li>
                <li>Create a guarded section in the python file that runs only if it is executed as a script, not when it's imported as a module.  It will start with 'if __name__== "__main__":'</li>
                <li>Place all code that should run in this guarded section.</li>
                </ol>
