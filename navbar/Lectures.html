                Jupyter notebooks are a great way to prototype; you can write a bit of code, test it and change it without having to restart a python kernel.  
                This is a huge debugging speedup since you only load data once, you do not have to reload it every time you change your code.<br>
                On the other hand, the debugger is primitive when compared to a full fledged IDE like PyCharm.<br>
                Also jupyter notebooks are used to prototype your solution.  Once everything works, you'll probably export the salient bits to packages and scripts to be used by other components, like a webservice or dashboard.<br>
                <!-- STOPPED WORKING 1/8/23-What's a dashboard? Its a way to aggregate and interactively display data in a user friendly way.  Here is an example <a href="https://kp-avocado.herokuapp.com">dashboard</a> (takes a bit to provision and load) created from <a href="https://realpython.com/python-dash/">this</a> excellent tutorial. -->
