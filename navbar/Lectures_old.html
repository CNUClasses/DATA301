                Jupyter notebooks are a great way to prototype; you can write a bit of code, test it and change it without having to restart a python kernel.  
                This is a huge debugging speedup since you only load data once, you do not have to reload it every time you change your code.<br>
                On the other hand, the debugger is primitive when compared to a full fledged IDE like PyCharm.<br>
                Also jupyter notebooks are used to prototype your solution.  Once everything works, you'll probably export the salient bits to packages and scripts to be used by other components, like a webservice or dashboard.<br>
                What's a dashboard? Its a way to aggregate and interactively display data in a user friendly way.  Here is an example <a href="https://kp-avocado.herokuapp.com">dashboard</a> (takes a bit to provision and load) created from <a href="https://realpython.com/python-dash/">this</a> excellent tutorial.

                <!-- https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/mutual-information  A great first step is to construct a ranking with a feature utility metric, a function measuring associations between a feature and the target. Then you can choose a smaller set of the most useful features to develop initially and have more confidence that your time will be well spent. -->

                The metric we'll use is called "mutual information". Mutual information is a lot like correlation in that it measures a relationship between two quantities. The advantage of mutual information is that it can detect any kind of relationship, while correlation only detects linear relationships.

                    3. Time all 3 methods, PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP.  (Use %%time cell method) to get relative performance information specific to this problem.  BTW You should always consider algorithm efficiency (In computer science we use Big O notation as a proxy for this).  
                    But first and foremost you want the correct answer, PCA will get the same answer every time, while t-SNE will not given it's probablistic nature and potential to get stuck in local minima.  In other words, you likely get different answers on different runs for t-SNE (it may also find structure where none exists). OTOH, it generates pretty clusters.<br>

                <!-- a script which does all the data preprocessing steps shown in the jupyter notebook -->
                <br><br>Jupyter notebooks are for rapid prototyping. They make it easy to load data once, and then iteratively and quickly run and document experiments. 
                They are not meant for production environments since they tend to display lots of UI and require intervention to run each cell.  
                If your notebook is purely exploratory, that is it only plots various aspects of data, then you need do nothing else. 
                If however, your notebook produces something (like a processed dataset), then it's a good idea to port it's relevant content to a script that requires no user interaction, and displays no UI. This approach has the following advantages:<br>
                1. It ensures repeatable results since the script always executes the same way.<br>
                2. The script can be executed by another script, which means it can be a building block used in other processes.<br><br>

                <ol>
                <li>Ignore all notebook code that explores the data (plotting with matplotlib, seaborn, various DataFrame statistics like unique and value_counts)</li>
                <li>Export relevant functions to a python file (idealy in a seperate package for maximum flexibility).</li>
                <li>Create a guarded section in the python file that runs only if it is executed as a script, not when it's imported as a module.  It will start with 'if __name__== "__main__":'</li>
                <li>Place all code that should run in this guarded section.</li>

                    2.Features are not correlated.</strong><br><br>

                    Permutation Importance.  Works for any model.  Scramble the data in one column and then measures how model performence drops, if you do this for all columns then you have a notion of a features importence from the models perspective. Use these importances to rank features.  Leads to interesting conclusions. 
                    For instance, in the voteranalysis project. If you calculate permutation importance for just 1 class of voters, you will see which issues (according to your model) were the most import to that class of voters for the 2016  election.<br>-->
                    <strong>Algorithms that show prediction changes as feature(s) are permuted.<br>
                    </strong> Lets you ask questions of a model (see'PDP and ICE plots' notebook to the right ). 2 algorithms to consider<br>
                    
                    ICE plots : measures the effect on target prediction when permuting column(s) on 1 row.<br>
                    PDP : average of ICE plots<br>
                    <strong><a href="https://github.com/CNUClasses/DATA301/blob/master/content/lectures/week10/10_PDP_ICE_Explain.pdf">PDP and ICE plots</a></strong>
                    Measure what happens to model predictions when 1 or 2 features are permuted. For instance, if model is trained on housing data, PDP plots can tell you what effect lattitude and longitude have on housing prices<br>
                    
<br>
                    <strong>Algorithms that quantify each feature contribution for a particular prediction.</strong><br>
                    treeinterpreter: why a particular prediction was made, what features influenced it.  Why 2 different groups of predictions differ.  May not be activly maintained.<br>
                    SHAP: why a particular prediction was made, what features influnced it.  Activly maintained. <br>

                    <strong>How to get the probability instead of class membership from a Random Forest classifier</strong><br>
