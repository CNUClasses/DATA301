               <b>Working with messy data</b><br>
               When collecting data, think carefully how you survey constituents. For example, when seeking someone's job title; <br> 
               If entered by text box, there will likely be many different responses for the same job (ie. 'software engineer', 'programmer', 'developer', 'SE1')<br>
               If entered by a combo box however, with carefully predefined choices, you eliminate this problem (ie. if the only relevant choice is 'Software Developer' then that's what software developers choose)<br><br>
